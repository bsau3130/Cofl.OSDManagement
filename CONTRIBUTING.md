# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please discuss the change you wish to make via GitHub issue with the owners of this repository.

Please note we have a code of conduct, and please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed or included in the .gitignore file, as well as any other unnecessary files, to reduce project bloat.
2. Update the documentation with details of changes to the interface, including new cmdlets, parameters, and aliases.  
   Most of the time, this can be done by running `.\build.ps1`, then double-checking the modified files in the `docs` folder.

    - Please ensure that all cmdlets have at least one example.
3. Increase the version number in `Cofl.OSDManagement.psd1` and any other affected files to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
4. A project maintainer will sign off and merge the Pull Request. If some time passes without a response from a project maintainer, please `@mention` them on the pull request issue.

## Code of Conduct
Don't be a jerk.

Examples of being a jerk:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harrasment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

Some harsh criticism is acceptable, but please try to phrase it constructively ("this is a better way to do it") rather than destructively ("your way is stupid").

### Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by @mentioning the project maintainers on any offending comment or issue, or by contacting the project team at <cllacour@mtu.edu>. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. If contact is via e-mail, the project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
